	\textbf{Review of Daniel MÃ¸lmark-oconnors hand-in}\\
\end{center}

Backpropaation section makes no sense, I do see your point of introducing it before the other sections and to better define why it is needed when discussing the future topics, but it ends up just being confusing and out of place. It would be better suited with a either incredibly thorough explanation with each term or in the other sections describe what is needed.\\

The variables in the mathematical formula are ambiguous, what is the C, what is the z? It would be better suited if these were explained shortly as for a better understanding of the concept.\\

The Softmax function section could be better suited with an explanation of a step function and a comparison with two graphs showing the difference. This would provide the reader with a better understanding of the concepts.\\

The Binary Cross entropy section is short and concise. Although it would be better off with an example of where it is used and why.\\

The Gradient descent section is good, bolstered with a fine definition and a great example in terms of mental visualization.
