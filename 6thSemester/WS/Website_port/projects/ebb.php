        <h3>This project is my current work-in-progress game, it has been on-going for about a month of spare time. It is conceptually the biggest project that I have delved into so far, as it is meant to be a full game, ergo training every aspect of game-making since I plan to create every asset from scratch completely.<br><br>This game is going to be a horror game, which I plan to release on the <i>Steam</i> platform once it is done. I prefer not to release too much information on the story so far, as I do not want to spoil it for future players.<br><br>In this project, I am practising and developing within the following aspects of game-development:
<ul>
<li>3D and UI Animation</li>
<li>3D rigging, skeleton animation and weight painting</li>
<li>Normal maps, Reflection maps, Bump maps and textures</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
<li>Level-design and map-layouts</li>
<li>Character controllers, lights and volumetric lighting</li>
<li>Materials and Shaders</li>
<li>Audio processing: Reverb, Echo and Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Controls and player-environment interaction</li>
<li>Breadcrumb style storytelling</li>
<li>A.I. in terms of Navigation mesh agents</li>
<li>Dynamic camera effects based on concurring in-game events</li>
<li>Making of sound-effects, soundtracks and horror elements.</li>
</ul>
This project has, hands down, been the one to improve my skills the most in terms of an all-around game-developer.
