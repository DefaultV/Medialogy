        <h3>This project is a released game available at the google play store, I've spent around a total of 60 hours on it. 
				<br><br>This project has had me delving into integrating monitization and in-app-purchasing systems from the Unity Platform. As well as making game design decisions based on the target group of hyper casual gamers.
				<br><br>In this project, I practised and developed within the following aspects of game-development:
<ul>
<li>UI Animation and currency shops</li>
<li>Gradient shaders</li>
<li>Optimisation for low-end mobile devices</li>
<li>SFX</li>
<li>Interaction design</li>
</ul>
This project has given me insight into the mobile game market, and how to develop a game, for a hyper casual gaming audience.
