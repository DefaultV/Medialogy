        <h3>This project was made to practise my 2D skills. It involved working with UI elements as well as sprites and dynamic loading. One of the feats were that the game was made to load a map or level directly from a text file with only a few numbers inside. These numbers would then represent the type and height of the tiles in-game.<br><br>The game was meant to be a fan-made successor of the <i>"Final Fantasy: Tactics" game, with similar elements. One goal of the project was also to experiment with easy-to-learn UI elements and joystick controls. But the biggest goal was 2D sprite animations and effects.<br><br>The project was made in Unity and all elements except the default character sprites and some sound-effects, were made by myself from scratch.</i></h3>
