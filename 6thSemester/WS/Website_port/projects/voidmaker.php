        <h3>This project was developed for furthering my interest and experience with UI elements and making an animated interface with multiple moving components. It also served to further some procedural and simulation practise.<br><br>The game was about simulating the evolution and development of civilizations on different planets that the player would make themselves with allocated resources. The planets would then simulate and develop themselves to a point where they reached space-travel and could interact with other planets. This would result in either co-operation or enslavements, determined by how far each planet were in their technology advancements, but also in terms of the resources their own planet had.<br><br>In this project I got a lot of experience with:
<ul>
<li>The animator and the UI in the Unity engine</li>
<li>Work with the camera and interpolation of the camera and objects</li> 
<li>Experience with the audio-sources in terms of spatial audio</li>
<li>Skyboxes</li>
</ul>
The project was made in Unity, with all the elements besides the sound-effects, soundtrack and the skybox, made from scratch.</h3>
