Think of any game

A loyal soldier of a supernatural army is cast into oblivion after being a threat to the throne. He now thirsts for vengeance, but to fulfill his destiny he must travel through the underworld, defeat past demons and feed on their souls to become stronger. Throughout the game you gain more abilities to battle your foes, the world is gritty and dark, but has a flipside coin to it which the player can enter when he/she has fed on enough souls to become whole, the reality and the underworld, this flipcoin universe allows the player to traverse obstacles and arrive at new possibly places, which were previously unreachable. Different abilities make you able to interact with the environment in a new way, etc wings for gliding, being able to pass through metal bars(underworld only) and attain a soulsword to fight enemies.
