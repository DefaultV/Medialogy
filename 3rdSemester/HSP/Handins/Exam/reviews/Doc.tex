\section{Self-reflection on the essay and the reviews}
\subsubsection{Response to Author 1}
The thresholding section, pointed out by Author 1, does indeed seem out of place and may be too short for having any relevance to the rest of the detailed topics elaborated on beforehand.\\

Author 1 explains how more sources could have been used to support the factual content of the essay. This could indeed help the credibility of both the original author and relay the factual content with more certainty. Although you could argue whether it is indeed needed for relaying the goal of this essay.\\

I must also concur with the description given of edge completion. That section would definitely benefit from having a figure to illustrate what is meant, as the reader can have potential trouble imagining everything the author meant.

\subsubsection{Response to Author 2}
Author 2 makes the claim that the report is missing a discussion section which would elaborate on comparison to media-technology, and that the report is \textit{"pure theory"}. If Author 2 had read the section introduction of Section 2 Theory and comparisons, Author 2 would know that the human senses and perception theory were to be explained alongside a comparison and discussion of the media-technological counterpart iteratively.\\Author 2 is also incorrect in stating both that it is a report and that the content is \textit{"pure theory"}. The assignment is an essay, and the essay does indeed hold fundamental facts.\\

Author 2 also makes a note that the theme is not very apparent in the essay. This does make sense if you are looking for a comparison between one Human senses and perception topic against a media-technological counterpart, although this essay does indeed cover multiple areas, hence the author of the essay may have been confused as to what to specifically call the essay.\\

Small but still noteworthy is that the description of what a "visual system" is, could potentially have aided in helping the reader understand what was being relayed, in that section of the essay.\\

Lastly, author 2 also mentions that some learning goals are missing, this could potentially be open for discussion, whether or not all the human perceptual systems are relevant to the original authors semester project, as it revolved only around detecting hand postures given in a scene.\\

\underline{Overall}\\
There seem to be a few holes in the essay, in relation to descriptions of scientific terms used, such as "Visual system". Else the essay seems fulfilling and relevant. The essay also contains credible sources, which are all relevant to the respective topics.
