 - Depth map
 - Depth raytracing, how much reflect/refract
 - Rounding error, optimization is the reasons we normalize vectors
 - Definition of cosine = adjacent/opposite gives angle
 - shadowray pr. light source
 - # of samples is how many rays per pixel, upping this will scale a "higher definition" to have a better look
 - cross is normal vector
 - can cross, dot, and project
 - cosine 90 = 0, das rite
