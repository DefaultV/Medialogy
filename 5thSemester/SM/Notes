1 -> Referential meaning. During the Depression, a tornado takes a girl from her
    family's Kansas farm to the mythical land of Oz. After a series of adventures,
    she returns home. ( Summary )

2 -> Explicit meaning. A girl dreams of leaving home to escape her troubles.
    Only after she leaves does she realize how much she loves her family and
    friends. Nothing she finds elsewhere can replace them. ( Meaning )

3 -> Implicit meaning. An adolescent who must soon face the adult world yearns
    for a return to the simplicity of childhood, but she eventually accepts the
    demands of growing up. ( Look deeper, abstract second plot( Moral of the story ) )

4 -> Symptomatic meaning. In a society in which human worth is measured by
    money, the home and the family may seem to be the last refuge of human
    values. This belief is especially strong in times of economic crisis, such as
    that in the United States in the 1930s. ( Reflecting times )

2nd lecture
------------------------------
Mise en scéne, "Putting into the scene"
1 Setting - environment, objects and props
2 Costume and Makeup
3 Lighting - quality, color, source and direction
4 Staging - Movement and Performance, everything moving, but also emotions and presentation of actors etc.

Dimensions of performance, stylized vs individualized

------------------------------
3rd lecture
------------------------------
Miśe-en-scene - Real world
Cinematography - Done to camera
Editing - Scenes conducted into a bigger picture
Sound - duh

Exposure triangle theory
----
1. Photographic aspect
2. Framing
3. Duration: the long take
Explained below
----
1. -||-
* Range of tonalities - Color, contrast, exposure (communicating atmosphere)
* Speed of motion - FPS_SCREEN/FPS_RECORDED (Control fps basically)
* Perspective - Focal length, Depth of field(focus, selective, deep and racking)(e.g. walking on a brigde lol)

2. -||-
Composition affects audience impression
* Dimension and shape(aspect ratio)
* Onscreen and offscreen space(fictional world extends beyond frame, sounds can contribute, behind camera or set, gradually revealing information to the audience)
* Angle, level, height and distance(viewer identifies with the lens, angle can hide the offscreen elements, or hide elements from the actor, extremes are unnatural, roll angles can be applied to confuse audience or disorient, pov shots)
* The mobile frame, Rotation, translation(tracking shot, crane shot), zooming, steady vs handheld. reframing(guiding audience attention in one scene between multiple focus points), follow shot(disorients viewer and leads them astray).

3. -||-
pacing and stuff


The "FINALLY" lecture.
- ------------------------- -
- Audio and sound in movies -
- ------------------------- -
Intro bell indicates time for something, conjunction with storm sets a dark mood
After kidnapping, muffled bass to denote sadness or sorrow with a bit of strings
Phone call, intense bass in terms of heartbeat to set stress
Planning phase/dropoff,

Short informative intro,
then action, guy gets kidnapped
Wallet then, "Man on fire"
wallet again, family
sister holds wallet
office with info, eavesdropping in home.
earcut, cops having a hard time?
flashing confusing shots, birds eye view
different places, guy is dropping clothes to show no wire?

-----------------------------
- Break
-----------------------------

A lot of history shit

wind(ambient), harp, VO, strings, relaxing christmas winter stuff?
Deep bass coming in, fade out again, viola giving intesity, crescendo?, deep tubas, bus, muffled when inside segment, orchestra giving a jolly score, prop sound effects, giving out jobs, zooming in makes it louder and vice versa, orchestra giving sad feeling, voice is louder when going over table, deafening orchestra. doors oopening ,second hand props again giving sounds, top right stereo on voice, voice is going off echoes and finally disappearing as the boss is going into coma lol. cars driving by, second hand again, music stops as the climax of the vocals reaches. timer from stopwatch gives attention and expectancy, car beep is scaring the actor.
voice of falling boss is dynamic with the camera range. screaming going on forever, big clock has the same sound as when someone is just dead.

Narrative
-----------------------------
Expectations ->
    Viewing films ->
        process of picking up cues
        recalling information
        anticipation and expectations
        curiosity, suspense and surprise
        -
        What will happen next, attachment to characters, captivating spaces
        ryan 2001, narrative as VR(bordwell and thompson, film art)

        narrative vs story vs plot
            narrative   -> chain of events linked by cause and effect, time and space(alternative is parallelism)
            story       -> The set of all the events in the narrative, both explicitly and how the viewer sees
            plot        -> Everything visibly presented in the film b4 us
            -
            Story
            |------------------------------------------|                   |
            | Presumed and    |   Explicitly presented | Added nondiegetic |
            | inferred events |   events               | Material          |
            |                 |--------------------------------------------|
            -                                                           Plot
            -
            Causes: we have two categories of causes and narratives; characters, animals/natural events.
            ------------------
            film clip; cause and effect, silence of the lambs
            hannibal knows he will get cuffed, so he hides a metal rod in his mouth
            cops readying since he is coming out
            mind the drawings, makes the cop move it out of the way, only to come back and get cuffed
            cop interrupting hannibal in his state of relaxation to the music
            stopped on 3rd, gives the cops potential for strategy, moves the story
            ambulance is called since a cop is still alive? or potentially alive
            blood is dripping from ceiling, giving actors the notice of looking up and investigating
            -
            ------------------

        Time and space
            Time -> Editing(e.g. 24 hours, follows realtime realworld hours, .e.g cloverfield camera movie)
            Space -> mise-en-scene(i, robot, blade runner)

        The flow of story information
            surprise vs suspense
                changing order of poker/bomb scenario, poker->clock->poker->bomb->explosion, bomb-> poker-> clock-> poker-> explosion

            restricted narration( we know what the actors know or less )
            unrestricted( audience knows more )

                    objective              subjective
            depth, (objective narration -> perceptual -> mental(monologue or dialogue)) (or standard narrator)
            heroes/antihero -> antihero is devoid of traits that hero has

            Vladimir propps:
            1. The hero
            2. The dispatcher(The questgiver)
            3. The villain
            4. The donor(Gives hero help with object)
            5. The helper(Helps the hero)
            6. The princess
            7. The false hero(Assume is good, is not)
            Actantial model:

                Axis of communication
            --------------------------->
            Sender -> Object -> Receiver

            in medias res (in the middle of things) vs at beginning
            causailty and plot patterns
                Change of knowledge
                Goal-oriented plot
                Investigation

                Patterns of repeated action
                Location
                "Repeated action + deadline"(can be mixed up)

            Gustav freitag (exposition -> rising action -> climax -> falling action -> denouncement)
            Syd fields -> three act structure -> setup, confrontation, resolution
            Robert mckee

            Circular structure, causality out the window
			Hollywood-model; Teaser(first draft?) -> (presentation) -> Elaboration -> Point of no return -> Conflict escalation -> Climax -> Resolution

EDITING NOTES
-------------

Murch's Rule of Six
Emotion - 51
Story - 23
Rhythm - 10
Eye-trace - 7
2D(plane of screen) - 5
3D(space of action) - 4

1. What is editing?
	- "the coordination of one shot with the next"
	- What does editing involve?
		- Joining desired shots together
		- cutting away superfluous frames
		- Selecting best takes and discarding the bad
	- Why cut?
		- Discontinuity is king
		- Guide the audience attention
		- Manipulate story and plot time
	-  Joining shots: transitions
		- Cross-dissolve
		- Wipe
		- Fade to and from back
2. Dimensions of film editing?
	- Relations between shots A and B
		- Graphic
		- Rhythmic
		- Spatial
		- Temporal
E.g. elements of mise-en-scene and cinematography across two shots: e.g. earth and eyeball both blue and round
	- Patterns of light and color
	- composition
	- Continuity vs discontinuity
	- smooth vs conspicious
	- pleasant vs uncomfortable
	e.g. eye line match height
	occupying negatgive screen space
	- Rhythmic relations
		- Movement in the mise-en-scene
		- camera position and movement
		- rhythm of the sound
		- the general context
	- Manipulation
		- Increased tempo 	---- ---- --- -- --
		- Decreased tempo 	-- -- --- ---- ----
		- Steady beat 		---- ---- ---- ----
	- Spatial relations
		- Constructive editing; A scene is entirely constructed from separate areas of space
		- Analytical editing; An establishing shot is shown before individual parts of the
			action is revealed through the following shots
	- Temporal relations
		Stories in editing
		1. Parallel stories
		2. Crosscutting(normal time)
		3. Overlapping editing(extends time)
		4. Elliptical editing(shortems time)
		5. Flashbacks and flashforwards
3. Continuity editing
"The basic purpose of the continuity system is to allow, space, time, and action to flow over a series of shots", e.g. cross arms one scene and arms by side second scene is not good, therefore we do continuity editing to make sure stuff is in the same place when changing camera.
Spatial continuity; 180 system -> JUST TELL THEM ABOUT THE TRIANGLE PRINCIPLE
(Establishing shot [Analytical editing]) eyelines matching etc.
	- Temporal continuity
		- Same as stories in editing, but make sure it's continuous.

[ SUMMARY ]
-----------
1. The coordination of one shot with the next
2. Graphical, rhythmic, spatial and temporal relations
3. Continuity editing
4. When to cut - { NOT AT THE EXAM }
