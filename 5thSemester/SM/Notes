1 -> Referential meaning. During the Depression, a tornado takes a girl from her
    family's Kansas farm to the mythical land of Oz. After a series of adventures,
    she returns home.

2 -> Explicit meaning. A girl dreams of leaving home to escape her troubles.
    Only after she leaves does she realize how much she loves her family and
    friends. Nothing she finds elsewhere can replace them.

3 -> Implicit meaning. An adolescent who must soon face the adult world yearns
    for a return to the simplicity of childhood, but she eventually accepts the
    demands of growing up.

4 -> Symptomatic meaning. In a society in which human worth is measured by
    money, the home and the family may seem to be the last refuge of human
    values. This belief is especially strong in times of economic crisis, such as
    that in the United States in the 1930s.

2nd lecture
------------------------------
1 Setting - environment, objects and props
2 Costume and Makeup
3 Lighting - quality, color, source and direction
4 Staging - Movement and Performance

Dimensions of performance, stylized vs individualized

------------------------------
3rd lecture
------------------------------
MiÅ›e-en-scene - Real world
Cinematography - Done to camera
Editing - Scenes conducted into a bigger picture
Sound - duh

Exposure triangle theory
----
1. Photographic aspect
2. Framing
3. Duration: the long take
Explained below
----
1. -||-
* Range of tonalities - Color, contrast, exposure (communicating atmosphere)
* Speed of motion - FPS_SCREEN/FPS_RECORDED (Control fps basically)
* Perspective - Focal length, Depth of field(focus, selective, deep and racking)(e.g. walking on a brigde lol)

2. -||-
Composition affects audience impression
* Dimension and shape(aspect ratio)
* Onscreen and offscreen space(fictional world extends beyond frame, sounds can contribute, behind camera or set, gradually revealing information to the audience)
* Angle, level, height and distance(viewer identifies with the lens, angle can hide the offscreen elements, or hide elements from the actor, extremes are unnatural, roll angles can be applied to confuse audience or disorient, pov shots)
* The mobile frame, Rotation, translation(tracking shot, crane shot), zooming, steady vs handheld. reframing(guiding audience attention in one scene between multiple focus points), follow shot(disorients viewer and leads them astray).

pacing and stuff


The "FINALLY" lecture.
- ------------------------- -
- Audio and sound in movies -
- ------------------------- -
Intro bell indicates time for something, conjunction with storm sets a dark mood
After kidnapping, muffled bass to denote sadness or sorrow with a bit of strings
Phone call, intense bass in terms of heartbeat to set stress
Planning phase/dropoff,

Short informative intro,
then action, guy gets kidnapped
Wallet then, "Man on fire"
wallet again, family
sister holds wallet
office with info, eavesdropping in home.
earcut, cops having a hard time?
flashing confusing shots, birds eye view
different places, guy is dropping clothes to show no wire?

-----------------------------
- Break
-----------------------------

A lot of history shit

wind(ambient), harp, VO, strings, relaxing christmas winter stuff?
Deep bass coming in, fade out again, viola giving intesity, crescendo?, deep tubas, bus, muffled when inside segment, orchestra giving a jolly score, prop sound effects, giving out jobs, zooming in makes it louder and vice versa, orchestra giving sad feeling, voice is louder when going over table, deafening orchestra. doors oopening ,second hand props again giving sounds, top right stereo on voice, voice is going off echoes and finally disappearing as the boss is going into coma lol. cars driving by, second hand again, music stops as the climax of the vocals reaches. timer from stopwatch gives attention and expectancy, car beep is scaring the actor.
voice of falling boss is dynamic with the camera range. screaming going on forever, big clock has the same sound as when someone is just dead.

Narrative
-----------------------------
Expectations ->
    Viewing films ->
        process of picking up cues
        recalling information
        anticipation and expectations
        curiosity, suspense and surprise
        -
        What will happen next, attachment to characters, captivating spaces
        ryan 2001, narrative as VR(bordwell and thompson, film art)

        narrative vs story vs plot
            narrative   -> chain of events linked by cause and effect, time and space(alternative is parallelism)
            story       -> The set of all the events in the narrative, both explicitly and how the viewer sees
            plot        -> Everything visibly presented in the film b4 us
            -
            Story
            
            |------------------------------------------|                   |
            | Presumed and    |   Explicitly presented | Added nondiegetic |

            -
            Causes: we have two categories of causes and narratives; characters, animals/natural events.
            ------------------
            film clip; cause and effect, silence of the lambs
            hannibal knows he will get cuffed, so he hides a metal rod in his mouth
            cops readying since he is coming out
            mind the drawings, makes the cop move it out of the way, only to come back and get cuffed
            cop interrupting hannibal in his state of relaxation to the music
            stopped on 3rd, gives the cops potential for strategy, moves the story
            ambulance is called since a cop is still alive? or potentially alive
            blood is dripping from ceiling, giving actors the notice of looking up and investigating

            ------------------

        Time and space
            Time -> Editing(e.g. 24 hours, follows realtime realworld hours, .e.g cloverfield camera movie)
            Space -> mise-en-scene(i, robot, blade runner)

        The flow of story information
            surprise vs suspense
                changing order of poker/bomb scenario, poker->clock->poker->bomb->explosion, bomb-> poker-> clock-> poker-> explosion

            restricted narration( we know what the actors know or less )
            unrestricted( audience knows more )

                    objective              subjective
            depth, (objective narration -> perceptual -> mental(monologue or dialogue)) (or standard narrator)
            heroes/antihero -> antihero is devoid of traits that hero has

            Vladimir propps:
            1. The hero
            2. The dispatcher(The questgiver)
            3. The villain
            4. The donor(Gives hero help with object)
            5. The helper(Helps the hero)
            6. The princess
            7. The false hero(Assume is good, is not)
