Following is a quick rundown:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \#1 Shot from out to in, forest being lush and saturated.
    \item \#2 Shot from inside, camera perspective from top right of the room, saturation is now decreased to make it seem void of life, panning as she walks and steps on some dropped porcelean.
    \item \#3 Camera from low angle, looking up towards riding hood entering into the bedroom, camera is behind bed so the person lying in bed is offscreen, or blocked by the bedframe, sounds will indicate heavy breathing, making the audience aware that something is lying in the bed.
    \item \#4 Riding hood stands at the end of the bed and starts the dialogue, camera facing her making sure that the audience cannot see what she is seeing, when the wolf responds (NEXT)
    \item \#5 Camera to window, having a shadow cast from the windowframe which covers the face.
    \item \#6 Camera now on the end of the bedframe, showing POV, wolfs paws are revealed as camera pans up and says his final line(eating riding hood), instant black frame and silence, only echoes of the last line is remaining.
\end{itemize}
\section{Mise-en-scene}
Overall, costumes for redcap will be a small red hoodie, and for the wolf a grandmothers or old gown. Redcap will have a bit of makeup, this will include red cheeks to better sell that she is a little helpless innocent girl. The wolf will be dirty and pelt visually sticky and disgusting.\\ Redcaps and the wolfs performance will be individualized.\\
The rest will be explained in a scene-by-scene manner:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \#1, Lighting and environment will be natural, an area in a forest where a hut can be easily built. The staging will be redcap hopping/walking following the pathway to the hut.
    \item \#2, When redcap enters the house, an prop will be standing on a table which is a vase with dead flowers in in. The lighting will have changed to cast dark shadows across the interior of the hut. Redcap will also have changed her movement by now being slow and curious.
    \item \#3, The bedroom will be dark, only one window is casting light with heavy shadows, the atmosphere will be dusty and gloom. Redcap will have changed performance to be afraid and nervous. The bedframe will serve to block the camera view a bit.
    \item \#4, Redcap will dialogue with the wolf, being nervous in her voice with lighting only being cast on her and the bed. High key lighting will be used in this scene, being cast on redcap.
    \item \#5, The window will cast a shadow to cover everything of the wolf above the torso, including the arms. Only the legs can be seen sticking out of the sheets. The wolfs sharp claws on his toes can be visually seen reflecting some light, this gives the perspective that redcap is in the light and the wolf is in the dark. Giving contrast between the characters innocense.
    \item \#6, The wolf will reveal itself using the shadow cast from the window as a medium of tension and final result of the scene, the wolfs eyes and siluette of his face is obscured by shadow but can be slightly seen.
\end{itemize}
% Divide the story segment into a series of shots, and for each shot describe how you would use the mise-en-scene to guide the audiencesâ€™ attention, arouse curiosity or suspense, and give the shots the desired emotional coloration. Specifically, describe how you will approach the setting, costumes and makeup, lighting, and staging (max 500 words).


\section{Cinematography}
% In a similar manner for each shot describe how you would use cinematography to change the audience experience. For each shot consider the photographic aspects, framing, shot duration, and the relevant sub-topics (max 500 words).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \#1, scene will be very lush and saturated with color digitally to claim a paradise like environment for redcap. Will be a still shot from the forestside of the hut. Shot will change as soon as redcap is through the door.
    \item \#2, camera view will be just behind a table close to the camera. This will blur the table contents which include a vase with a dead plant, but the focus will be of the background where redcap is entering the house. The saturation will now be decreased to make the scene seem mysterious and devoid of joy. The angle of the camera could indicate that redcap is being watched by something. The pacing will also have changed a bit to reflect redcaps curiousity and slower movements than previous scene.
    \item \#3, the bedframe will be occluding the vision of the viewer, showing only the facial expressions of redcap as she is entering and looking and the bed nervously/scared, sound will also be used to indicate the offscreen element of the wolf, making the audience know the wolf is in the bed but have their vision of him occluded. Camera angle will be elevated to the same height as redcap to show how big the bed and the rest of the environment really is. Making everything seem overwhelming and distorted to a childs view.
    \item \#4, camera will now be on the end of the bedframe, showing only the feet of the wolf and redcaps full face, the camera angle will be elevated to redcaps height and slowly pan closer to her face aswell as decreasing the FoV to give an eerie feeling, making the audience uncomfortable as redcap speaks her dialogue.
    \item \#5, camera angle will now be above the windowframe to give an extreme unnatural feeling of the room, as redcap speaks her final pieces of her dialogue.
    \item \#6, camera will finally be from redcaps perspective, a PoV shot of what she is seeing lying in the bed. Slowly panning towards the wolf with eerie sound as he reveals his big paws and finally his face and mouth, with the camera zooming into the mouth when he eats redcap.
