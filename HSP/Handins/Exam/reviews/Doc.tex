\subsection{Reviews of my report}
\subsubsection{Author 1}

The author demonstrates knowledge about the topic and many different facts can be learned by reading it. However, it would have been little bit better if more information about some topics was included.\\

The content is organized really good. An improvement could be a "Table of Contents".\\

The sources are referenced and cited in a way that makes it easy for the reader to follow. The reference style is correct and provided with links. The sources that are used are the book and few external sources. For a better argumentation within the report, the author could have used more sources.\\

The factual content in the report is correct, explained in a good way. It is certain that the reader can learn a lot about the author’s topic.\\

The report fits perfectly based on the required length.\\

The author does show knowledge of the topics corresponding to the learning goals, however, it would have been better if more external information was used in the core parts of the report. The information that the author has used is primarily from the book for the course HSP.\\

The author has managed to create a structure that is easy and pleasant to follow.\\

There aren’t any flaws in the referencing style and system the author has used.\\

Overall, the report is decent.\\

There are only few, perhaps minor, mistakes. One of them is at the end of section 2.2.1, where the author gives an example with edge completion:\\

“An example would be three circles which all have a small triangle shape cut out of them all, but the circles are aligned to certain angles to give off the illusion that there is a triangle to be perceived in the missing space, between the circles.”\\

This could have been improved with the use of an image instead of trying to describe how that image should look like.\\

Also, there is a little part explaining how Thresholding functions (section 2.2.2). Often Thresholding could be a crucial part of image processing and is surely something really important in the context of shape detection in image processing, however, it doesn’t really relate to the main topic of the report, since it revolves around the human senses and Thresholding is far away from that.\\

\subsubsection{Author 2}

The author demonstrate knowledge of his chosen topics to a good extend and include information from some of the learning goals such as “Discuss how the human perceptual system compares to computational systems” and “Explain how the human perceptual systems work”, but I still find it hard to tell specifically what theme the author chose for this report and what underlying questions have been answered.
The factual content of the report is good with some minor adjustments, as when the author mentions the visual system but does not give an explanation of the term. The author makes a short and precise introduction of light and the human eye and photoreceptors but some of the information is maybe a bit redundant for the purpose of this report, in regards of the explanation of accommodation which could possibly have been left out.\\

The report is presented with a good layout that creates a good overview and navigation of the report and is structed so the reader can easily point out the topic of each section.\\

The citation format is done correctly in APA style with some minor mistakes on how to cite when the author cites references such as “(Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017)” where the first letter of Abrams first name should not be mention in the citation, and when the author references multiple writings in “(Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017) (Biederman, 1987)”, as it should all be under the same parenthesis such as (Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017; Biederman, 1987). The author makes use of academic references to support the validity of his report.\\

Overall good report in regards of presenting precise and informative theory that is relevant for the authors semester project but lacks major parts of the report, such as a discussion section and a section where the author elaborates on the presented theory in the report in regards to his semester project. The semester project is briefly mentioned in the introduction and is then forgotten and not mentioned for the rest of the report. I find it hard to tell if the author picked any of the proposed themes we could choose to write about or simply just picked some aspects of the different themes that are relevant to his semester project. The author demonstrate knowledge of his chosen topics to a good extend and include information from some of the learning goals such as “Discuss how the human perceptual system compares to computational systems” and “Explain how the human perceptual systems work”, but I still find it hard to tell specifically what theme the author chose for this report and what underlying questions have been answered.\\

The grammar is overall good with minor mistakes such as “It is a iterative” where a should be an, and “and then then the” with double then in the same sentence which could indicate rushed writings with no proper readthrough. The writing is generally good but resembles the writing of its references.\\

The author provides a good explanation of how the camera works compared to the human eye and makes use of a good illustration in figure 4 “Illustration of Border Ownership and Figure-ground Organization” to visualize and understand the concept that could be a bit abstract to visualize in the brain. On the contrary to this, the report could have had great use of an illustration to help visualize the concept of edge completion, which we sadly are left to paint in our heads ourselves.\\

The citation format is done correctly in APA style, with some minor mistakes on how to cite when the author cites references such as “(Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017)” where the first letter of Abrams first name should not be mention in the citation, and when the author references multiple writings in “(Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017) (Biederman, 1987)”, as it should all be under the same parenthesis such as (Yantis and A.Abrams, 2017; Biederman, 1987). The author makes use of academic references to support the validity of his report. The report is of adequate length and is in between the 2000-2500 word count.\\

The author makes some good points about how our visual perception are compared to media-technology, but then again misses a discussion section where he can elaborate on how this compares to modern society and the use of media-technology. The report is pure theory and does not relate the presented theory to the authors semester project.\\

\subsubsection{Response to Author 1}
The thresholding section, pointed out by Author 1, does indeed seem out of place and may be too short for having any relevance to the rest of the detailed topics elaborated on beforehand.\\

Author 1 explains how more sources could have been used to support the factual content of the essay. This could indeed help the credibility of both the original author and relay the factual content with more certainty. Although you could argue whether it is indeed needed for relaying the goal of this essay.\\

\subsubsection{Response to Author 2}
Author 2 makes the claim that the report is missing a discussion section which would elaborate on comparison to media-technology, and that the report is \textit{"pure theory"}. If Author 2 had read the section introduction of Section 2 Theory and comparisons, Author 2 would know that the human senses and perception theory were to be explained alongside a comparison and discussion of the media-technological counterpart iteratively.\\Author 2 is also incorrect in stating both that it is a report and that it is \textit{"pure theory"}. The assignment is an essay, and the essay does indeed hold fundamental facts.\\
