-- 1.5 The Process of Interaction Design --

Establishing requirements 1 -> Who are target users
Designing alternatives    2 -> Suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements
Prototyping               3 -> Evaluate through interaction
Evaluating                4 -> Determine usability and accetability 

--------------------------------------------------------
-- 1.6.1 Usability Goals --

effective to use -> 		(effectiveness)
efficient to use -> 		(efficiency)
safe to use -> 			(safety)
having good utility -> 		(utility)
easy to learn -> 		(learnability)
easy to remember how to use -> 	(memorability).

--------------------------------------------------------

Low fidelity prototypes -> e.g paper hat for imitation
High fidelity prototypes -> e.g nearly final hat

--------------------------------------------------------
-- Interface 6.* --

Window design -> enabling more information but sacrificing overview, some have fixed this (mac with swipe view)
Form filling -> suggestions based on prefix words
Menu interfaces -> Flat lists, drop-down, pop-up, contextual and expanding (scrolling & cascade(sideways drop"down"))

-- 6.3 --
Emerging class of HCI sybtle triggered by information obtained imlicitly from the user. (Solovey et al 2014) Using brain, body, behave, and environmental sensors. Providing a whole new aspect of HCI.

--------------------------------------------------------
-- The process 9.* --
User-centered design: User guides designer
Activity-centered design: Behavior surrounding particular tasks (user behaviour rather than need)
Systems design: Structured, rigorous and holistic design approach, focus: context for complex problems
Genius design: System(the people, computers, objects, devices) are center of attention -> user only sets goals
(Genius design differs, relies solely on experience and creative flair of a designer)

Prototyping is important (Get requirements and make ONE prototype and refine until complete)
user involvement should be balanced, too much can lead to problems

-- 9.2.3 --
User centered approach:
* Early focus on users and tasks
* Empirical measurement
* Iterative design


Establish requirements <-> design alternatives <-> prototype -> evaluate -> (design alternatives) -> revert or final product

--------------------------------------------------------
-- Cognition 3.* --

-- What is cognition 3.2 --
* Attention
* Perception
* Memory
* Learning
* Reading, speaking & listening
* Problem solving, planning, reasoning & decision making
(Rare for one to occur in isolation)


--------------------------------------------------------
-- Understanding and Conceptualizing interaction 2.* --

* Problem space -> Assumptions and claims, highlight those that are vague or wanting, poorly constructed design ideas can be reformulated.
Explicate and explore problems for each role, leading to a specific avenue of investigation agreed on by the team.
* Concenptualize interaction
->  Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g.
    browsing, bookmarking).
->  The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task–domain objects they create and manipulate, their
    attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing).
->  The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others,
    and whether an object is part of another).
->  The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit
    through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites).
The best models appear obvious, operations are intuitive to use -> can be based on overly complex conceptual models when upgraded /w too many functions. Offering multiple ways of doing one thing can be weighed against a constrained interface that offers only one way.
* Paradigms, visions, theories, models and frameworks informing interaction design ->
->  To follow a particular paradigm means adopting a set of practices that a community has agreed upon. These include:
    the questions to be asked and how they should be framed;
->  the phenomena to be observed;
->  the way in which findings from studies are to be analyzed and interpreted (Kuhn, 1972)
(IoT) -> all connecte through internet with their own with unique identifier.

* Future visions
->  How to enable people to access and interact with information in their work, social, and everyday lives, using an assortment of
    technologies.
->  How to design user experiences for people using interfaces that are part of the environment but where there are no obvious
    controlling devices.
->  How and in what form to provide contextually relevant information to people at appropriate times and places to support them while
    on the move.
->  How to ensure that information that is passed around via interconnected displays, devices, and objects is secure and trustworthy.

Gestalt laws of grouping(principles)
* Proximity
* Similarity
* Common region
* Continueity
* Focal point
* Figure/ground -> relationship between object and surrounding space
* Closure


--------------------------------------------------------
-- Data gathering 7.* --

Data gathering <-> Analysis and interpretation <-> Establishment of requirements (Identifying needs & establishing requirements)
Common 3 forms:
 * Questionnarires (May be Open-ended, check boxes || rating scales)
 * Interviews -> Individual / Focus group (Unstructured / Structured / Semi-structured / Group interview)
 * Observation -> Direct / Indirect
 * Studying ddocumentation
 * Similar products

Influence
* Focus of the study
* Involved participants
* Nature of the technique
* Available resources

*Goal setting.
  In relation to what the data should be pointed towards, will influence the nature of data gathering.
*Identifying participants.
  What kind of people are we working with (Characteristics, capabilities. What are they trying to achieve, how are they currently achieving it?, Can it be more efficient || more enjoyable manner?)
  ** Probability sampling
    -Simple random sampling / stratified sampling
  ** Non-probability sampling
    -Convenience sampling || volunteer panels
    ** Convenience sampling
      -Available rather than specifically selected
*The relationship between the data collector and the data provider (Participants).
  Should be clear and professional -> sign a consent form.
*Triangulation.
  1. Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people
    (possibly by using a different sampling technique).
  2. Investigator triangulation means that different researchers (observers, interviewers, etc.) have been used to collect and interpret the
    data.
  3. Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings.
  4. Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques.
*Pilot studies.
  Do a pilot study before the real deal, participants can be unpredictable.
  It can save time, something might be wrong with a question or scenario.
  Getting comments from peers or collegues can be a substitue for a pilot study.

--------------------------------------------------------
-- Data analysis 8.* --
Simple quantitative analysis  -> Basically How much from 1 - 5 scale. (Scatter diagram can isolate outliers) (Numbers vs not numbers) (Verification vs exploration) [SEE P. 278] <Mode, Median, Mean>
Simple qualitative analysis   -> Identify recurring patters or themes e.g Usability test with UP. <PROBLEM NR#> 
Detailed analysis in qualitative areas can be: Themes, patterns, categories. Another is: Critical incident technique (p. 242)
Grounded theory: -> The aim of grounded theory is to develop a theory that fits a set of collected data. In this context, theory is: “a set   of well-developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used   to explain or predict phenomena” (Strauss and Corbin, 1998).

--------------------------------------------------------
-- Establishing requirements 10.* --
What -> Functional requirements
How -> Non-functional requirements
*(Requirements activity) 2 aims -> (1)Understand as much as possible about the user, activities & context of it. (2)Produce set of stable requirements to form a basis to start designing. Get feedback, the end goal is to produce this set of requirements. -> Requirements activity.
*(How can we achieve this?) The activity is iterative, keeps changing. gather data -> analyse -> interpret -> extract info.
Look at page 285, for figure of the importance of getting it right the first time, fixing bugs later can be very costly.

* Functional requirements -> What should the product do (Fundamental)
* Data requirements       -> Capture type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy and value of specified data.
* Environmental requirements    -> Which circumstances should the product operate. (4 aspects to consider when establishing requirements)
  * Physical environment        -> Lighting, noise, movement and dust in operational environment (User equipment, crowded, etc)
  * Social environment          -> Collaboration & coordination needs to be explored, e.g. will data need to be shared? Does it have to be sync?
  * Organizational environment  -> How good is user support going to be, effeciency and stable communications infrastructure.
  * Technical environement      -> What techs will the product need to be compatible with, what limitations are relevant?

* User -> Non-frequent user will need instructions whereas frequent user will need more power of control and flexible interaction.
(Remember personas) -> Rich descriptions of typical users of the product. -> 
    "Each persona has a name, often a photograph, and some personal details such as what they do in their leisure time.
    It is the addition of precise, credible details that helps designers to see the personas as real potential users, 
    and hence as people they can design for."
---
---
Interviews      -> good for exploring issues, semi-structured or unstructured interviews are good early to elicit scenarios.
Focus group     -> good for gaining consensus view and highlighting areas of conflict and disagreement during the requirements activity.
Questionnaires  -> gaining initial responses and after analysis choose a person for an interview,
                   or be used to get a wider perspective on particular issues
Direct observation -> Understand the nature of the tasks and context in which they are explored.
Indirect observation -> if a product is evolving or being developed iteratively, this is for later use to log and put observation into diaries
Studying documentation -> Manuals & other documentation serve as good source of data about steps involved. good for understanding legislation
                          and getting some background information on the work
Researching similar products -> to get or help prompt requirements.
---
---
In short 
: "observation to understand the context of task performance
: interviews to target specific user groups
: questionnaires to reach a wider population
: focus groups to build a consensus view."
---
---
Five models?
(0)Contextual inquiry -> rests on four main principles: context, partnership, interpretation, and focus. Apprenticeship model, the designer works as an apprentice to the user.
(1)The context principle emphasizes the importance of going to the workplace and seeing what happens.
(2)The interpretation principle says that the observations must be interpreted in order to be used in design, and this interpretation should
also be developed in cooperation between the user and the developer.
(3)the focus principle, is related to our discussions in Chapter 7 about keeping the data gathering focused on your goals
---
---
Data gathering guidelines for requirements:
* Focus on identifying the stakeholders’ needs.
* Involve all the stakeholder groups.
* Involving only one representative from each stakeholder group is not enough.
* Support the data gathering sessions with suitable props, such as task descriptions and prototypes if available.
--
--
Include wide range of participants, Dont ban silly ideas, build one idea on top of another, keep record of your ideas, sharpen the focus, warm up
-- Task description 10.6 --
--
Scenarios -> Much like personas, just with a specific activity instead. p 301.
Mixed with a final goal for the (Persona -> scenario -> goal), 
----------------------
-- 10.6.2 Use cases --
----------------------
About user-system interaction (Much like assembly language)

Task analysis is used mainly to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new products. It is used to analyze the underlying
rationale and purpose of what people are doing: what are they trying to achieve, why are they trying to achieve it, and how are they going
about it? The information gleaned from task analysis establishes a foundation of existing practices on which to build new requirements
or design new tasks.
--

Hierachical task analysis
S1: Forming a goal,
S2: Forming the intention
S3: Specifying the action
S4: Execute the action
S5: Percieve the state of the world
S6: Interpret the state of the world
S7: Evaluate the outcome
